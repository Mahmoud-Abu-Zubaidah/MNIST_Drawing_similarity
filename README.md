# Drowing Similarity.


Finding similarity between two images is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of their underlying structures, rather than merely comparing their color distributions. This repository aims to address this challenge by employing a deep learning model capable of detecting subtle changes and differences in images, enabling accurate similarity analysis.

# The Siamese Nural Network:

  The Siamese Neural Network, utilized in this project, operates by learning the intricate patterns present in images and subsequently computing the distance between them. By establishing a threshold, the network determines whether the images are similar or dissimilar based on their learned features.
